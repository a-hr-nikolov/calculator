# Calculator with vanilla JS

As it is, this project is fairly simple, so it is no surprise that vanilla JS handles it without much trouble.

There wasn't anything particularly challenging, aside from the fact that one has to think about how calculators actually work.I like breaking things down and figuring out their step-by-step operation, so that didn't bother me much.

## Initial Requirements

1. Code the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

2. Create a simple calculator design with button input
3. Add keyboard support

## My additions

1. Make the design responsive
2. Handle longer outputs
